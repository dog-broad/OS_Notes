# Distinguish Multithreading and Multitasking.

Multi-tasking and multi-threading are two techniques used in operating systems. Multi-tasking allows the CPU to execute multiple independent processes or tasks concurrently, sharing the same processor and resources. On the other hand, multi-threading involves dividing a single process into multiple threads that can execute concurrently, sharing the same memory space and resources of the parent process.

# How do you handle the mouse events using java AWT. Explain.

In Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), mouse events can be handled using two interfaces:

**1. MouseListener:** This interface is used to handle basic mouse events like mouse clicks, mouse enters (when the mouse cursor enters a component's area), mouse exits (when the mouse cursor exits a component's area), and mouse button releases.

**2. MouseMotionListener:** This interface is used to handle mouse motion events, such as mouse dragging (when the mouse is moved with a button pressed) and mouse movement (when the mouse is moved without any button pressed).

To use these interfaces, you need to implement their methods and attach the listener to the component you want to monitor for mouse events.

Here's a minimal example program that demonstrates how to handle mouse events using Java AWT:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MouseEventsExample extends Frame implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener {

    public MouseEventsExample() {
        addMouseListener(this);
        addMouseMotionListener(this);
        setSize(300, 200);
        setTitle("Mouse Events Example");
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Clicked at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Entered at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Exited at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Pressed at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Released at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Dragged at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Moved at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new MouseEventsExample();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Java AWT Frame and implement both MouseListener and MouseMotionListener interfaces. We override their respective methods to print messages when various mouse events occur. The `main` method creates an instance of our custom class `MouseEventsExample`, and the program displays the frame. When you run the program and interact with the window using the mouse, you will see the corresponding messages in the console.

# Differentiate applets from application programs.

|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Meaning                     | A stand-alone program that runs on the underlying OS.    | A small program embedded in a web page and runs on the client-side.   |
| Requirement of main( ) method | Execution starts with the main( ) method, which is mandatory. | Initialization occurs through the init( ) method, and main( ) is not required. |
| Execution                  | Requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run.         | Runs on a Java-based web browser with APIs like Web API.     |

| Operation                  | Can perform read and write tasks on local files.          | Limited access to browser-specific services, no local system operations. |
| File access                | Can easily access files on the local computer.            | Cannot access files on the local system or computer.      |
| Security                   | Generally trusted and comes with no security concerns.    | Considered less reliable and needs to be secured.         |

In summary, Java applications are standalone programs that run on the underlying operating system and require the main( ) method for execution. They have full access to local resources and can establish connections with other servers. On the other hand, Java applets are small programs embedded in web pages, run on the client-side within a Java-based web browser, and are limited in accessing local resources and establishing server connections.

# Sketch the MVC architecture and also explain each and every component in it.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a widely-used design pattern in web development to organize code effectively. It emphasizes the separation of concerns, dividing a program or application into three distinct components: Model, View, and Controller.

![](2023-08-03-18-48-19.png)

### Components of MVC Architecture:

1. **Model**: The Model represents the business logic and data of the application. It is an object that carries data and can also contain the logic to update the Controller if the data changes. In simple terms, it handles the data and its manipulation.

2. **View**: The View represents the presentation layer of the application. It is responsible for visualizing the data present in the Model. The View is used to display information to the user in a format that is understandable and user-friendly.

3. **Controller**: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It manages the flow of the application, handling user requests, and updating the View whenever there is a change in data. The Controller serves as the backbone of the MVC pattern.

### How MVC Works in Java:

The process of interaction in MVC can be summarized as follows:

1. A user/client (e.g., a web browser) sends a request to the Controller on the server side, requesting a specific page or action.

2. The Controller then calls the Model to gather the required data.

3. Once the data is retrieved, the Controller transfers it to the View layer for presentation.

4. The View processes the data and generates the final output, which is sent back to the user/client (browser) for display.

### Advantages of MVC Architecture:

MVC architecture offers several advantages, making it a popular choice for organizing web applications:

1. **Scalability**: MVC supports application growth as the components can be easily extended and modified without affecting other parts.

2. **Easy Maintenance**: The separation of concerns in MVC reduces dependencies between components, making them easier to maintain and update.

3. **Reusability**: The Model can be reused by multiple Views, leading to code reusability and saving development time.

4. **Concurrent Development**: Developers can work simultaneously on different layers (Model, View, and Controller) without interfering with each other's code.

5. **Clarity and Understandability**: MVC enhances application readability and understandability by dividing it into three distinct parts, making it easier for developers to comprehend and work with the codebase.

6. **Simplified Codebase**: Since each layer is maintained separately, developers do not have to deal with massive code files, reducing complexity.

7. **Easier Extension and Testing**: The modularity of MVC makes it easier to extend the application's functionality and perform unit testing on individual components.

In conclusion, the MVC architecture in Java separates concerns and improves maintainability, reusability, and scalability of web applications. By dividing the application into Model, View, and Controller, developers can work efficiently and create more organized and manageable codebases.

# Demonstrate the usage of inter-thread communication in Java with a suitable example.

Inter-thread communication or cooperation is a mechanism that allows synchronized threads in Java to communicate with each other. It involves pausing a thread in its critical section and allowing another thread to enter the same critical section for execution. This is implemented using the following methods of the Object class: wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

1. **wait() method**: The wait() method causes the current thread to release the lock and wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed. It must be called from a synchronized method, otherwise, it will throw an exception.

2. **notify() method**: The notify() method wakes up a single waiting thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If multiple threads are waiting, one of them is chosen arbitrarily and awakened.

3. **notifyAll() method**: The notifyAll() method wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.

**Example of Inter Thread Communication in Java**:

Let's see a simple example of inter-thread communication:

```java
class Customer {    
    int amount = 10000;    
    
    synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {    
        System.out.println("going to withdraw...");    
        if (this.amount < amount) {    
            System.out.println("Less balance; waiting for deposit...");    
            try { wait(); } catch (Exception e) {}    
        }    
        this.amount -= amount;    
        System.out.println("withdraw completed...");    
    }    
    
    synchronized void deposit(int amount) {    
        System.out.println("going to deposit...");    
        this.amount += amount;    
        System.out.println("deposit completed... ");    
        notify();    
    }    
}    
    
class Test {    
    public static void main(String args[]) {    
        final Customer c = new Customer();    
        
        // Thread to withdraw
        new Thread() {    
            public void run() { c.withdraw(15000); }    
        }.start();    
        
        // Thread to deposit
        new Thread() {    
            public void run() { c.deposit(10000); }    
        }.start();    
    }    
}
```

In this example, we have a `Customer` class with two synchronized methods `withdraw` and `deposit`. When the `withdraw` method is called, it checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the current balance. If so, it waits for a `notify` signal. Meanwhile, the `deposit` method is called from another thread, which deposits money into the account and then sends a `notify` signal to wake up the waiting thread. This way, the `withdraw` and `deposit` methods are synchronized and communicate with each other to manage the customer's balance.


# Explain about Event classes, Event sources, Event listeners and the relationship among them.

Event classes, event sources, and event listeners are essential concepts in programming that allow different parts of a program to communicate with each other when certain actions or events happen. Let's understand each concept in simpler terms:

1. **Event Sources**:
An event source is like a signal sender in a program. It generates signals or events when something important happens. Imagine it as a button that you press, and it tells other parts of the program that the button was pressed. These events can be things like clicking a button, pressing a key, or moving the mouse.

2. **Event Listeners**:
An event listener is like a signal receiver in a program. It waits and listens for specific events from the event source. It's like an attentive person who keeps an eye on the button and reacts when it is pressed. When an event occurs, the listener does something in response to that event. For example, if the button is clicked, the listener may perform a particular action, like opening a new window.

3. **Event Classes**:
An event class is like a message that carries information about the event. It helps the event listener to understand what exactly happened. For example, the event class might say, "ButtonClickedEvent" or "KeyPressedEvent," so the listener knows which event occurred and can respond accordingly.

**Relationship among them**:
The event source and event listener work together to make a program interactive. Here's how it works:
1. The event source generates an event when something happens, like a button being clicked.
2. The event class describes the event, saying it's a button click event.
3. The event source sends this event to the event listener, saying, "Hey, a button was clicked!"
4. The event listener receives the event and knows what kind of event it is.
5. The event listener performs a specific action based on the event, like displaying a message when the button is clicked.

By using event sources, event listeners, and event classes, programs can respond to user actions and external events in a flexible and organized way. This allows for more interactive and user-friendly applications.

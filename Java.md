# Distinguish Multithreading and Multitasking.

Multi-tasking and multi-threading are two techniques used in operating systems. Multi-tasking allows the CPU to execute multiple independent processes or tasks concurrently, sharing the same processor and resources. On the other hand, multi-threading involves dividing a single process into multiple threads that can execute concurrently, sharing the same memory space and resources of the parent process.

| S.NO | Multitasking                                                 | Multithreading                                                      |

# How do you handle the mouse events using java AWT. Explain.

In Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), mouse events can be handled using two interfaces:

**1. MouseListener:** This interface is used to handle basic mouse events like mouse clicks, mouse enters (when the mouse cursor enters a component's area), mouse exits (when the mouse cursor exits a component's area), and mouse button releases.

**2. MouseMotionListener:** This interface is used to handle mouse motion events, such as mouse dragging (when the mouse is moved with a button pressed) and mouse movement (when the mouse is moved without any button pressed).

To use these interfaces, you need to implement their methods and attach the listener to the component you want to monitor for mouse events.

Here's a minimal example program that demonstrates how to handle mouse events using Java AWT:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MouseEventsExample extends Frame implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener {

    public MouseEventsExample() {
        addMouseListener(this);
        addMouseMotionListener(this);
        setSize(300, 200);
        setTitle("Mouse Events Example");
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Clicked at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Entered at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Exited at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Pressed at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Released at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Dragged at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Mouse Moved at (" + e.getX() + ", " + e.getY() + ")");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new MouseEventsExample();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Java AWT Frame and implement both MouseListener and MouseMotionListener interfaces. We override their respective methods to print messages when various mouse events occur. The `main` method creates an instance of our custom class `MouseEventsExample`, and the program displays the frame. When you run the program and interact with the window using the mouse, you will see the corresponding messages in the console.

Please note that the actual usage and behavior of Java applications and applets may vary depending on the specific implementation and requirements. The table provides a general comparison between the two based on common characteristics and use cases.

In summary, Java applications are standalone programs that run on the underlying operating system and require the main( ) method for execution. They have full access to local resources and can establish connections with other servers. On the other hand, Java applets are small programs embedded in web pages, run on the client-side within a Java-based web browser, and are limited in accessing local resources and establishing server connections.

# Sketch the MVC architecture and also explain each and every component in it.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a widely-used design pattern in web development to organize code effectively. It emphasizes the separation of concerns, dividing a program or application into three distinct components: Model, View, and Controller.

![](2023-08-03-18-48-19.png)

### Components of MVC Architecture:

1. **Model**: The Model represents the business logic and data of the application. It is an object that carries data and can also contain the logic to update the Controller if the data changes. In simple terms, it handles the data and its manipulation.

2. **View**: The View represents the presentation layer of the application. It is responsible for visualizing the data present in the Model. The View is used to display information to the user in a format that is understandable and user-friendly.

3. **Controller**: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It manages the flow of the application, handling user requests, and updating the View whenever there is a change in data. The Controller serves as the backbone of the MVC pattern.

### How MVC Works in Java:

The process of interaction in MVC can be summarized as follows:

1. A user/client (e.g., a web browser) sends a request to the Controller on the server side, requesting a specific page or action.

2. The Controller then calls the Model to gather the required data.

3. Once the data is retrieved, the Controller transfers it to the View layer for presentation.

4. The View processes the data and generates the final output, which is sent back to the user/client (browser) for display.

### Advantages of MVC Architecture:

MVC architecture offers several advantages, making it a popular choice for organizing web applications:

1. **Scalability**: MVC supports application growth as the components can be easily extended and modified without affecting other parts.

2. **Easy Maintenance**: The separation of concerns in MVC reduces dependencies between components, making them easier to maintain and update.

3. **Reusability**: The Model can be reused by multiple Views, leading to code reusability and saving development time.

4. **Concurrent Development**: Developers can work simultaneously on different layers (Model, View, and Controller) without interfering with each other's code.

5. **Clarity and Understandability**: MVC enhances application readability and understandability by dividing it into three distinct parts, making it easier for developers to comprehend and work with the codebase.

6. **Simplified Codebase**: Since each layer is maintained separately, developers do not have to deal with massive code files, reducing complexity.

7. **Easier Extension and Testing**: The modularity of MVC makes it easier to extend the application's functionality and perform unit testing on individual components.

In conclusion, the MVC architecture in Java separates concerns and improves maintainability, reusability, and scalability of web applications. By dividing the application into Model, View, and Controller, developers can work efficiently and create more organized and manageable codebases.

# Demonstrate the usage of inter-thread communication in Java with a suitable example.

Inter-thread communication or cooperation is a mechanism that allows synchronized threads in Java to communicate with each other. It involves pausing a thread in its critical section and allowing another thread to enter the same critical section for execution. This is implemented using the following methods of the Object class: wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

1. **wait() method**: The wait() method causes the current thread to release the lock and wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed. It must be called from a synchronized method, otherwise, it will throw an exception.

2. **notify() method**: The notify() method wakes up a single waiting thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If multiple threads are waiting, one of them is chosen arbitrarily and awakened.

3. **notifyAll() method**: The notifyAll() method wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.

**Example of Inter Thread Communication in Java**:

Let's see a simple example of inter-thread communication:

```java
class Customer {    
    int amount = 10000;    
    
    synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {    
        System.out.println("going to withdraw...");    
        if (this.amount < amount) {    
            System.out.println("Less balance; waiting for deposit...");    
            try { wait(); } catch (Exception e) {}    
        }    
        this.amount -= amount;    
        System.out.println("withdraw completed...");    
    }    
    
    synchronized void deposit(int amount) {    
        System.out.println("going to deposit...");    
        this.amount += amount;    
        System.out.println("deposit completed... ");    
        notify();    
    }    
}    
    
class Test {    
    public static void main(String args[]) {    
        final Customer c = new Customer();    
        
        // Thread to withdraw
        new Thread() {    
            public void run() { c.withdraw(15000); }    
        }.start();    
        
        // Thread to deposit
        new Thread() {    
            public void run() { c.deposit(10000); }    
        }.start();    
    }    
}
```

In this example, we have a `Customer` class with two synchronized methods `withdraw` and `deposit`. When the `withdraw` method is called, it checks if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the current balance. If so, it waits for a `notify` signal. Meanwhile, the `deposit` method is called from another thread, which deposits money into the account and then sends a `notify` signal to wake up the waiting thread. This way, the `withdraw` and `deposit` methods are synchronized and communicate with each other to manage the customer's balance.


# Explain about Event classes, Event sources, Event listeners and the relationship among them.

Event classes, event sources, and event listeners are essential concepts in programming that allow different parts of a program to communicate with each other when certain actions or events happen. Let's understand each concept in simpler terms:

1. **Event Sources**:
An event source is like a signal sender in a program. It generates signals or events when something important happens. Imagine it as a button that you press, and it tells other parts of the program that the button was pressed. These events can be things like clicking a button, pressing a key, or moving the mouse.

2. **Event Listeners**:
An event listener is like a signal receiver in a program. It waits and listens for specific events from the event source. It's like an attentive person who keeps an eye on the button and reacts when it is pressed. When an event occurs, the listener does something in response to that event. For example, if the button is clicked, the listener may perform a particular action, like opening a new window.

3. **Event Classes**:
An event class is like a message that carries information about the event. It helps the event listener to understand what exactly happened. For example, the event class might say, "ButtonClickedEvent" or "KeyPressedEvent," so the listener knows which event occurred and can respond accordingly.

**Relationship among them**:
The event source and event listener work together to make a program interactive. Here's how it works:
1. The event source generates an event when something happens, like a button being clicked.
2. The event class describes the event, saying it's a button click event.
3. The event source sends this event to the event listener, saying, "Hey, a button was clicked!"
4. The event listener receives the event and knows what kind of event it is.
5. The event listener performs a specific action based on the event, like displaying a message when the button is clicked.

By using event sources, event listeners, and event classes, programs can respond to user actions and external events in a flexible and organized way. This allows for more interactive and user-friendly applications.


# What is a Layout manager? Explain the different types of Layout managers in detail.

A Layout Manager in Java enables us to control how visual components are arranged in GUI forms by determining their size and position within containers. There are six types of Layout Managers in Java:

1. **FlowLayout**: Components are arranged from left to right and top to bottom like words on a page. If the container is not wide enough, components wrap around to the next line. Vertical and horizontal gaps between components can be controlled, and components can be left, center, or right-aligned.

2. **BorderLayout**: Components are placed along the edges or in the middle of the container (top, bottom, right, left). Components added to the top or bottom get their preferred height and fill the width of the container. Those added to the left or right get their preferred width and fill the remaining height. The center component covers the remaining area.

3. **GridLayout**: Components are arranged in a grid of equally sized cells, added from left to right and top to bottom. Each cell can hold only one component, and all cells have the same size. When the container is resized, cells are automatically resized. Components are placed based on the order they were added.

4. **GridBagLayout**: This powerful layout arranges components in a grid of cells and maintains the aspect ratio of objects when the container is resized. Cells may have different sizes, and the layout allows for consistent gaps between components. Default alignments can be specified for components within columns or rows.

5. **BoxLayout**: Components are arranged either vertically or horizontally, but not both. For horizontal alignment, all components have the same height (equal to the largest component's height). For vertical alignment, all components have the same width (equal to the largest component's width).

6. **CardLayout**: It arranges components with the same size in a deck-like manner, where only the top component is visible at any time. Components are displayed either horizontally or vertically, and the first component added is kept at the top.

Example:

Suppose we have a simple Java Swing program with three buttons, and we want to arrange them horizontally using the FlowLayout manager:

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class LayoutExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Layout Example");
        JPanel panel = new JPanel();

        panel.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        panel.add(new JButton("Button 1"));
        panel.add(new JButton("Button 2"));
        panel.add(new JButton("Button 3"));

        frame.add(panel);
        frame.setSize(300, 100);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```


# Give the steps involved in developing and running an applet.

An applet is a Java program that runs in a Java-compatible browser such as Internetexplorer. This feature allows users to display graphics and to run programs over the Internet. An applet allows web documents to be both animated and interactive.

**Step 1: Import applet package and awt package:** To create an applet, our program must import the Applet class. This class is found in the `java.applet`  package. The Applet class contains code that works with a browser to create a display area. We also need to import the `java.awt` package. "awt” stands for `“Abstract Window Toolkit”`.  The java.awt package includes classes like `Graphics.`

**Step 2: Extend the Applet class:** Then, a class must be defined that inherits from the class ‘Applet’. It contains the methods to paint the screen. The inherited class must be declared public.

**Step 3: Override the paint method to draw text or graphics:** The paint method needs the Graphics object as its parameter.

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) { … }
```

The Graphics class object holds information about painting. We can invoke methods like drawLine(), drawCircle() etc. using this object.

  

**Syntax: The program looks something like this.**

```java
import java.applet.*;

import java.awt.*;

public class MyApplet extends Applet {
    public void paint(Graphics g)
    {                  
         g.drawString("Welcome to Programming”,50,50);  
    }
}
```

**Step 4: Compiling the Program:** After writing the program, we compile it using the command "javac MyApplet.java". This command will compile our code so that we now have MyApplet.class file.  

  

**Step 5: Adding applet to HTML document:** To run the applet we need to create the HTML document. The BODY section of the HTML document allows APPLET tag. The HTML file looks something like this:

```html
<HTML>  
<BODY>

    <APPLET code="MyApplet.class" width="200" height="200"></APPLET>

</BODY>  
</HTML>
```

**Step 6: Running an applet:** The applet can be run in two ways

1. Using appletviewer: To run the appletviewer, type appletviewer filename.html

2. Using web browser: Open the web browser, type in the full address of html file.

# Demonstrate the usage of thread synchronization in Java with a suitable example?

In Java, synchronization is used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. It ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time, preventing thread interference and consistency problems.

Thread synchronization in Java is achieved through mutual exclusion, which comes in two forms: synchronized methods and synchronized blocks.

1. **Synchronized Method**:
A method can be marked as synchronized, meaning only one thread can execute it at a time. When a thread enters a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the lock associated with the object and releases it when the method is complete.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

2. **Synchronized Block**:
A block of code can be synchronized, allowing only one thread to execute that block at a time. The synchronized block must specify an object on which the lock will be acquired.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object();

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

Both synchronized methods and synchronized blocks provide mutual exclusion and help prevent thread interference when multiple threads access shared resources.

The concept of locks in Java revolves around the monitor associated with each object. Threads that require consistent access to an object's fields must acquire the object's lock before accessing them and release it when done.

Thread synchronization is essential when dealing with concurrent programming, where multiple threads run simultaneously. It ensures data consistency and prevents race conditions.


# Distinguish Event Listeners from Event Adapters.

Event Listeners are interfaces used for specific event handling, requiring implementations of all methods. They are suitable when you need to handle a single type of event.  
On the other hand, Event Adapters are classes that provide default implementations for event listener methods. They are useful when you want to implement multiple event listener interfaces but handle only a few specific events. They enhance code readability and reduce redundancy by allowing selective method overrides.

| **Feature**                           | **Event Listeners**                            | **Event Adapters**                                                                                         |

# Illustrate the life cycle methods of an applet with a suitable program.

Applet Life Cycle in Java

In Java, an applet is a special type of program embedded in a web page to generate dynamic content. The applet has a life cycle consisting of five core methods: `init()`, `start()`, `stop()`, `paint()`, and `destroy()`. These methods are invoked by the web browser to execute and control the applet's behavior during its execution.

![](2023-08-03-19-37-53.png)

1. **init()**: The `init()` method is the first method to run when the applet is initialized. It is invoked only once at the beginning of the applet's execution. The web browser creates the applet object and calls the `init()` method to initialize it. This method is commonly used for applet setup and resource allocation.

2. **start()**: The `start()` method contains the actual code of the applet and starts its execution. It is invoked immediately after the `init()` method and also whenever the applet's page is refreshed or revisited. This method is useful for starting any ongoing activities or animations in the applet.

3. **paint()**: The `paint()` method belongs to the `Graphics` class in Java. It is used to draw shapes like circles, squares, and other graphical elements in the applet. The `paint()` method is executed after the `start()` method and whenever the applet's window is resized or refreshed.

4. **stop()**: The `stop()` method is called when the applet is paused or stopped, such as when the user navigates away from the applet's page or minimizes the browser window. It is also invoked when the applet moves from one tab to another in the browser. The `stop()` method can be used to pause or halt ongoing activities in the applet.

5. **destroy()**: The `destroy()` method is called when the applet is no longer needed and is about to be removed from memory. It is executed when the applet's window is closed or when the tab containing the webpage is closed. The `destroy()` method is used for cleanup tasks, releasing resources, or saving data before the applet is terminated.

The sequence of method execution when an applet is executed is as follows:

1. `init()`: Applet initialization
2. `start()`: Applet execution starts
3. `paint()`: Applet draws graphical elements
4. `stop()`: Applet execution stops (e.g., user navigates away)
5. `destroy()`: Applet cleanup and termination

The Java plug-in software manages the life cycle of the applet, ensuring proper execution and resource management. The applet runs on the client-side within a web browser and doesn't have a `main()` method because it is designed to be placed on an HTML page. To create an applet, we extend the `Applet` class and override its methods to customize its behavior. The `paint()` method, which belongs to the `Graphics` class, is used to draw graphical elements within the applet.

Example of Applet Life Cycle:

```java
import java.applet.*;

public class MyApplet extends Applet {
    public void init() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    public void start() {
        // Start execution code here
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // Drawing code here
    }

    public void stop() {
        // Stop execution code here
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code here
    }
}
```


# Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components. Justify.

**Swing: Platform-Independent and Lightweight Components**

Swing, a Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit, offers platform-independent and lightweight components that make it an ideal choice for developing cross-platform applications.  

Its pure Java implementation, consistent behavior, and efficient performance make it an essential toolkit for building visually appealing and responsive applications that work seamlessly across different platforms.

1. **Platform-Independence**: Swing components are written in pure Java, meaning they are not reliant on any specific operating system's native code or APIs. Instead, they utilize Java's Graphics and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to render their appearance and handle events. As a result, Swing applications can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without modification, providing a consistent user experience across different operating systems.

2. **Lightweight Architecture**: Swing follows a lightweight architecture, which differentiates it from heavyweight GUI toolkits. Unlike heavyweight toolkits that rely heavily on the operating system's windowing system, Swing components are drawn and managed by Java code. This approach ensures that Swing applications consume fewer resources and have faster startup times, making them more efficient and responsive.

3. **Pluggable Look and Feel**: Swing's Look and Feel (L&F) mechanism allows developers to customize the appearance and behavior of Swing components. Swing offers various L&F options, including the default Java L&F, which mimics the look and feel of the native operating system. Additionally, developers can choose third-party L&Fs to create visually distinctive applications. The pluggable L&F contributes to Swing's platform independence by enabling applications to adapt to the native look and feel of the host system.

4. **Consistent Behavior**: Swing components exhibit consistent behavior across different platforms. Whether it's a button, text field, or checkbox, each component behaves the same way, irrespective of the underlying operating system. This ensures a uniform user experience and simplifies development by reducing the need to handle platform-specific differences.

5. **Performance**: The lightweight nature of Swing contributes to its superior performance. By minimizing reliance on the operating system's windowing system, Swing components efficiently manage painting, event handling, and rendering. The use of double-buffering techniques also helps to eliminate flickering, resulting in smoother animations and user interactions.

6. **Extensibility**: Swing offers a rich set of components that can be easily customized and extended. Developers can create their own custom components or extend existing ones to suit specific application requirements. This level of extensibility empowers developers to craft unique user interfaces that cater to their application's needs.



# How many types of ways are there for creating threads?  Explain each with an example.

There are two main ways to create threads in Java: 

1. **Extending the Thread class**:
   - To create a thread by extending the `Thread` class, you need to override the `run()` method in the subclass. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed when the thread is started.
   - Once the `run()` method is defined, you can create an instance of the subclass and call the `start()` method on it to begin the execution of the thread.

```java
// Example of creating a thread by extending the Thread class

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        thread1.start();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main Thread: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Implementing the Runnable interface**:
   - To create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface, you need to implement the `run()` method in the class that implements `Runnable`. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed when the thread is started.
   - Once the `run()` method is defined, you can create an instance of the class that implements `Runnable`, and then pass it to a `Thread` object's constructor. Finally, call the `start()` method on the `Thread` object to begin the execution of the thread.

```java
// Example of creating a thread by implementing the Runnable interface

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread2.start();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main Thread: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```


# How do you handle the Key events using java AWT. Explain.

In Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), key event handling is used to respond to user interactions with the keyboard. Key events occur when a user presses or releases a key on the keyboard while the focus is on a component that can receive keyboard input, such as a text field or a button.

To handle key events in Java AWT, you need to follow these steps:

1. Implement the KeyListener interface: The KeyListener interface provides three methods that need to be implemented to handle key events:
   - `keyPressed(KeyEvent e)`: This method is called when a key is pressed down.
   - `keyReleased(KeyEvent e)`: This method is called when a key is released.
   - `keyTyped(KeyEvent e)`: This method is called when a key is typed (pressed and released).

2. Register the listener with the component: Once you have implemented the KeyListener interface, you need to register the listener with the component that will receive the key events. You can do this using the `addKeyListener()` method.

3. Override the key event handling methods: In the implementation of the KeyListener interface, you will override the three key event handling methods to specify the actions to be performed when a key is pressed, released, or typed.

Here's a simple example demonstrating key event handling for a text field:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class KeyEventsExample extends Frame implements KeyListener {
    TextField textField;

    public KeyEventsExample() {
        setTitle("Key Events Example");
        setSize(300, 200);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());

        textField = new TextField(20);
        textField.addKeyListener(this);

        add(textField);

        setVisible(true);
    }

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Key Pressed: " + e.getKeyChar());
    }

    public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Key Released: " + e.getKeyChar());
    }

    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Key Typed: " + e.getKeyChar());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new KeyEventsExample();
    }
}
```


# Illustrate the ways of passing parameters to applets.

In Java applets, parameters can be passed from the HTML file to the applet. This allows us to customize the behavior or appearance of the applet based on the values provided in the HTML code. To pass parameters to an applet, we use the `<param>` tag in the HTML file, and then the applet can access these parameters using the `getParameter()` method.

Let's illustrate the ways of passing parameters to applets with an example:

Example of an Applet with Parameters:
1. Java Applet Code (UseParam.java):
```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class UseParam extends Applet {
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        String str = getParameter("msg");
        g.drawString(str, 50, 50);
    }
}
```

2. HTML File (myapplet.html):
```html
<html>
<body>
    <applet code="UseParam.class" width="300" height="300">
        <param name="msg" value="Welcome to applet">
    </applet>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have created an applet named `UseParam` that extends the `Applet` class. Inside the `paint()` method, we use the `getParameter("msg")` method to retrieve the value of the parameter named "msg" passed from the HTML file.

In the HTML file, we use the `<applet>` tag to embed the applet in the web page. The `code` attribute specifies the class file of the applet (`UseParam.class`). Inside the applet tag, we use the `<param>` tag to pass the parameter "msg" with the value "Welcome to applet" to the applet.

When the HTML file is executed in a web browser, the applet will be displayed with the message "Welcome to applet" drawn at the position (50, 50) on the applet window.

Using parameters in applets allows us to make our applets more versatile and dynamic, as we can change their behavior simply by modifying the values of the parameters in the HTML code.


# Compare and contrast any 4 AWT and Swing components

1. **AWT Button vs. Swing JButton:**
   - AWT Button: AWT provides the `Button` class to create clickable buttons. It uses the native platform's appearance for rendering.
   - Swing JButton: Swing provides the `JButton` class that creates buttons with a more consistent look across different platforms. It is lightweight and provides better control over appearance and behavior.

2. **AWT TextField vs. Swing JTextField:**
   - AWT TextField: AWT offers the `TextField` class for single-line text input. It is heavyweight and uses the native platform's rendering for text.
   - Swing JTextField: Swing provides the `JTextField` class, which is lightweight and provides consistent text input fields with additional features like text alignment, password mode, and text validation.

3. **AWT Label vs. Swing JLabel:**
   - AWT Label: AWT has the `Label` class for displaying text or images. It uses native rendering for text and images.
   - Swing JLabel: Swing provides the `JLabel` class, which offers more flexibility, supports HTML rendering, and can display images, icons, or custom components.

4. **AWT List vs. Swing JList:**
   - AWT List: AWT provides the `List` class to create simple lists of text items. It is limited to displaying text and has basic functionality.
   - Swing JList: Swing offers the `JList` class, which is more powerful and supports custom data models, multiple selections, and complex rendering with custom cell renderers.

# Properties/Criteria of an Algorithm:

1. **Clear and Unambiguous:** An algorithm should be expressed in a clear and unambiguous manner. Each step must be precisely defined and leave no room for interpretation or confusion. This ensures that anyone following the algorithm will execute the same steps and produce the same results.

2. **Well-Defined Inputs:** If an algorithm requires input, these inputs should be well-defined. The algorithm should specify the type, format, and range of acceptable inputs. This ensures that the algorithm can handle a variety of inputs without ambiguity.

3. **Well-Defined Outputs:** An algorithm must specify the expected output or outcomes. This output should also be well-defined and relevant to the problem being solved. The algorithm should provide a clear description of the result it aims to achieve.

4. **Finiteness:** The algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps. This ensures that the execution of the algorithm doesn't go on indefinitely, making it feasible for practical use. Infinite loops or processes that never terminate are not considered valid algorithms.

5. **Feasible:** An algorithm should be feasible to execute using available resources. It should not rely on technologies or resources that are not currently available. It should be practical, efficient, and possible to implement within the constraints of the computing environment.

6. **Language Independent:** Algorithms should be designed in such a way that they can be implemented in any programming language. The logic and steps of the algorithm should remain the same regardless of the programming language used. This promotes flexibility and compatibility.

7. **Input:** An algorithm can accept zero or more inputs. It should be designed to handle various input scenarios effectively. Algorithms with input parameters can adapt to different situations and provide customized outputs based on those inputs.

8. **Output:** An algorithm must produce at least one output. The output should be meaningful and relevant to the problem being solved. Even if the algorithm is used for internal calculations, it should provide some form of result that contributes to the solution.

9. **Definiteness:** Each step in an algorithm must be unambiguous, clear, and easy to understand. Any person referring to the algorithm should be able to interpret the instructions without confusion. The use of precise language and logical constructs is crucial here.

10. **Finiteness:** An algorithm must have a termination condition, ensuring that it will finish executing within a finite number of steps for any input. This prevents infinite loops and guarantees that the algorithm will eventually produce a result or halt.

11. **Effectiveness:** The algorithm should be constructed using basic, simple, and feasible operations. It should be possible to trace and execute the algorithm using manual methods, like pencil and paper. Complex or abstract operations that are difficult to follow are not ideal for an algorithm.

Explanation of the Algorithm Design Steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:** Begin by thoroughly comprehending the problem you're tasked with solving. Understand its context, requirements, constraints, and desired outcomes.

2. **Decide the Exact Appropriate Solution:** Based on your understanding of the problem, determine the most suitable approach or solution strategy. This decision is guided by your analysis of the problem's characteristics.

3. **Algorithm Design Techniques:** Choose the appropriate algorithm design techniques that align with your chosen solution strategy. These techniques can include divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.

4. **Prove Correctness:** Before proceeding further, verify that your algorithm is logically correct. You need to ensure that it fulfills the problem's requirements and produces the expected results.

5. **Analyze the Algorithm (Is it Effective?):** Evaluate the algorithm's efficiency in terms of time and space complexity. If the analysis indicates that the algorithm is effective (fast and resource-efficient), proceed to coding.

6. **Code the Algorithm:** Translate your algorithm into actual code using a programming language. This step involves converting the logical steps into a syntax that a computer can understand and execute.

If the correctness of the algorithm is proven and the analysis indicates effectiveness, the algorithm progresses to the coding phase. If either condition is not met, you can revisit the choice of algorithm design techniques for refinement. This iterative approach ensures a well-crafted, correct, and efficient algorithm design.
